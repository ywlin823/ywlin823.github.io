# The 52-Week Money Challenge App
What’s 52 Weeks Money Challenge?
The idea is simple: You start by socking away just $1 in the first week of the year, and then gradually increase your savings by a dollar a week throughout the year. So you save $2 in Week 2, then $3 in Week 3, and so on, until you’re stashing away upwards of $50 a week next December.
By the end of the year, if you complete the challenge, you’ll have saved $1,378.
Saving even a small amount can make a big difference. 52 weeks money challenge is a great way to start!
I designed this app with my friend to help us track our money, as well as to give us timely reminders. This app will make it easier for you to save up to your first pot of gold! Here’s a really simple iOS App and Android App with a solid savings plan that anyone should be able to do.
